# Overview 

The License Plates dataset is a object detection dataset of different vehicles (i.e. cars, vans, etc.) and their respective license plate. Annotations also include examples of "vehicle" and "license-plate". This dataset has a train/validation/test split of 245/70/35 respectively.

# Use Cases

This dataset could be used to create a vehicle and license plate detection object detection model. Roboflow provides [a great guide](https://blog.roboflow.com/license-plate-detection-and-ocr/) on creating a license plate and vehicle object detection model.
